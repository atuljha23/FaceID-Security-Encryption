# FaceID Security Encryption

Encrypted Files that can only be decrypted using your FaceID. This Program uses FaceRecognition library and AES Encryption technique to do the both work. The file can only be accessed using your FaceID.


How it Works?

1. Run Face.py
2. Will ask for first time 2-Step Verification Password (Register your password)
3. Close the program
4. Run Face.py it will then detect your face and then if the face matches then the program will ask for 2-Step Verification password.
5. Then you can either decrypt your previous encrypted file or can decrypt your file.

Requirment:

1. Download facerecognition library for python from here.

2. Download Pycrypto 
https://pypi.org/project/pycrypto/
3. Your best quality face image in python file directory :P
